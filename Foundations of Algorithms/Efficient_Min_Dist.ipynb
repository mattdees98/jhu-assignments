If POINTS <= 3, the algorithm will simply perform brute force comparison to return M number of neighbors. If POINTS > 3, the algorithm will divide and conquer recursively, taking the midpoint as the length of POINTS/2 and splitting the data set into two data sets, P_l and P_r, where P_l contains points at or to the left of the midpoint and P_r contains points at or to the right of the midpoint. Then, the divide and conquer step begins, as 2 calls are made to the brute force function with inputs of P_l and P_r, the results of each is inserted into its own data set. The minimum distance between both of these data sets is found. Then, the algorithm will check the distance of cases where one point may lie on the left side of the midpoint and the other on the right. These 3 results are combined into a single, final data set, and sorted. Then, the results of this data set are returned based on the input M, for the M closest points in the data set.** "

    "**As seen in this graph, my algorithm closely follows the graph of $n * log(n)$ on small input sizes, but begins to tail off for larger input sizes. Although a decent representation, this analysis is not entirely accurate considering we are only taking into account the most expensive operation, which is calls to the function in which the distance calculation is done. In reality, I believe my function executes closer to $O(2(n * log(n)))$ time.**"

    "For this algorithm, I think I could have made improvements on the sorting of points to improve my asymptotic worst-case running time. Also, since I had trouble implementing the algorithm in general I used Python's built-in sort method for simplicity to help with figuring out the algorithm. If time permitted, I planned to implement a merge sort algorithm to sort the points. I also believe I could clean up the code in the brute-force algorithm that calculates the distance between points to make it operate faster, which would be significant since it is the function that is doing most of the work in the algorithm."
